      <h3>What is Diverse Music?</h3>
      <p>The type of music that made up the 2010s doesn’t fall into a certain genre like the other decades. Diverse music means Pop, Rap, R&B are all examples of popular music that took over the 10s. With the likes of Bruno Mars and Drake the 2010s had some big artists top the charts. The reason that the 10s are unlike other decades is because with the evolution of music genres have almost blended. Of course people can still be fully defined as rock, but Rap and R&B can coexist on the same song</p>
