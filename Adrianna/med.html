   <h1>Medieval Architecture</h1>
    <div id="p1">
      <p>Usually when thinking back to the Middle Ages we think about the wars and crusades but never do we look too much into the artistic aspect of the time, sepcifically in architecture. Mainly originating in Europe, medieval architecture included various styles, the top three being Pre-Romanesque, Romanesque and Gothic to create religous, civil and military buildings. For an overview, these buildings had a simple structure of doors and windows with round arches. For materials straw, cob, wood and wattle and daub were utilized, however, some were made out of stone and few of these still stand today.</p>
    </div>
<br>
    <h2>Romanesque</h2>
    
    <div id="p11">
      <p>The Romanesque style is commonly associated with the 11th century. It was the first widely European style since Roman architecture, being influenced by Italy and Southern France. Characteristics that identify architecture as Romanesque can be towering, semicircular arches, thick walls, small windows and large stone walls. This style was specifically popular in church buildings and was used to mimic biblical scenes. Barrel and groin vaults were used to support the roof and the huge walls contained its outward thrust. The objective of such architectural designs were to represent religion since art was recognized as a key to communication.</p>
    </div>


    <br>
    <h2>Gothic</h2>
    <div id="p111">  
      <p>Evolving from Romanesque architecture, Gothic architecture was developed in the 12th century mainly by France. During this time and with this style, the potential of the arch and vault was discovered in terms of how it is constructed and its appearance. Common with these designs are pointed arches, flying and external buttresses, ribbed vaults and asymmetry. Gothic architecture was also associated with religion as Gothic art in general was used for cathedrals and other religious buildings. The intention of the structure of these buildings were used to preserve natural light while still being tall. Glass and stone were the usual materials in this style. Stained glass was also quite common. By the 15th century, the Gothic style would be succeeded due to the Renaissance. </p>
