    <h1>The Renaissance</h1>
    <div id="p2">
      After the Middle Age era in architecture came the Renaissance. The Renaissance was a period starting from the 14th century that is widely recognized as a huge turning point in art along with other concepts. Things were explored from different persepctives, allowing an expansion in categories due to outbursts of creativity. It mainly included the revival of past ideas to exceed the standards of the original by encouraging individual ideas not only in art, but in literature and philosophy as well. Proportion and symmetry were focused on much more. Many of these buildings still stand today mainly in Florence, Italy.

  <h2>Early</h2>
    <div id="p22">
    <p>The Early Renaissance took place in the 1400s and included human philosophy ideas about man in relation to the universe and the world. It also focused on a person's individual relationship with God that didn't relate to the church. In architecture, the early Renaissance mainly focused on realism. This encouraged symmetry, proportion and mathematical precision when determining the structure of buildings. Arches were still common but so were columns, domes and pediments. </p>

    <h2 class="hgh">High</h2>
    <div id="p222">
    <p>The High Renaissance took place starting from the 1490s. Although it was short lived, this time continued to allow art to floursih. While still maintaining ideals from the early Renaissance, beauty was the major focus. The appearance of art and architecture was concentrated on largely and so was implementing intellectual harmony that represented calmness.

    <h2>Late</h2>
    <div id="p2222">
    <p>The Late Renaissance began somewhere around the 1520s and can also be referred to as Mannerism. This time was a period for cultural diffusion. Still maintaining realism and humanity ideals from the other stages of the Renaissance, portrayal and symbolism was a growing concept in art. Specifically, in architecture, there was a large diffusion from the Italian Renaissance to the rest of Europe. These ideas were incorporated into the process of creating buildings. This period was mainly just a conclusion to the Renaissance through the collective use of discoveries throughout this extremely influencial period. </p>
